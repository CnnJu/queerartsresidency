        <li>There is a bus that runs regularly over the mountain to the larger town of Egilsstaðir </li>

        <li>Occasionally the mountain pass - Fjarðarheiði - is closed due to exceptionally bad weather, cutting Seyðisfjörður off from the rest of the country </li>
        <li>Some parts of town can be evacuated after heavy weather due to avalanche or mudslide risk (the residency is in one of the safest zones so this is unlikely to impact the programme)</li>
