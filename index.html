        <h4>About</h4>
        <p>
          Heima Collective wants to highlight the importance of the queer community in the East of Iceland through a residency program for artists and activists from the LGBTQIA+ community.</br></br>
          The residency program aims to provide arts and cultural connections to queer artists and activists from around the world through growing and sharing of artistic skills, exhibitions, screenings, performances, workshops and collaborative creation in a site-specific context.</br></br>
          The residency program provides a residency for 7 international artists and/or activists who identify within the LGBTQIA+ community. The residency program in Heima Collective offers a space to live, work, share, experiment and discuss together whilst being in Seyðisfjörður, Iceland.</br></br>
          The residency program is for multidisciplinary queer artists/activists who reflect on queer related topics and care for the LGBTQIA+ movement through their practices.</br></br>
          The residency offers a program of 6 weeks from the 18th September 2025 till the 31st October 2025.</br></br>
          The framework of the residency program is partly created by Ra Tack and Ju Canon who bring fundamental guidelines regarding queerness, formed from years of experience, and partly created by the needs and aims of the current and past queer artists/activists in residence. The needs and aims are very much in constant flux but focuses on creating a safer space for LGBTQIA+ artists and giving a space to a marginalized community.</br></br>
          The queer artists/activists in residence will collectively organize themselves in the space regarding workspace, sleeping space and scheduling of shared meals, with strict consideration and care for the maintenance of the house and respect for each other.</br></br>
          Artists/activists in residence are invited to work with each other and with the local community.</br></br>
          Every week there is a gathering to share individual or collaborative works and/or work in progress. The presentation will take place within the Heima Collective space and Herdubreid Community Center in Seyðisfjörður. It is open to the public, which includes passers by, residents, and invited public. The events are advertised through social networks and posters.</br></br>
