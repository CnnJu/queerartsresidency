    <h4>OPEN CALL</h4>
    <h4>KIN MAKING</h4>
      <p>a residency and cultural exchange for LGBTQIA+ artists and activists in Seyðisfjörður, Iceland</br>
        We are excited to invite practitioners who are thinking/ dreaming/ making/ planning/ exploring/ playing at the intersection of LGBTQIA+ experience 
        and kinship to join us for a 6 week residency in Seyðisfjörður, Iceland.</br>
        The residency is open to artists, activists, researchers, careworkers, scientists, teachers, dancers, writers, parents, nannies, filmmakers… to develop 
        their praxis and explore the co-creation of a temporal family in the East fjords of Iceland.</br>
        Family can mean so many different things, and as LGBTQIA+ people, we can often have more complex and non linear journeys toward kinship - choosing the ways 
        we relate to one another, what it means to nurture and care for one another, what kind of relationship we can have with the more than human world, 
        how does inviting family feeling into the broader scope of relationship change the meaning of kinship? The invitation is broad and the scope is endless!</br>
        We look forward to hearing from you</br>

    <h4>the town</h4>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Seyðisfjörður is a vibrant, port town and community of about 600 people in the East Fjords</li>

        <li>The town has a large number of amenities for a place this size, including: a pool, gym, cinema, school, general store, community centre, pharmacy, art centre, art school, print workshop, wellness centre, wood and metal workshops, town hall, bank, sports hall, library and ski slope</li>
        <li>There is a bus that runs regularly over the mountain to the larger town of Egilsstaðir </li>

        <li>Some parts of town can be evacuated after heavy weather due to avalanche or mudslide risk (the residency is in one of the safest zones so this is unlikely to impact the programme)</li>
